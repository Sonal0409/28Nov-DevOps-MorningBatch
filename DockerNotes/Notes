docker commands will always work with root permissions

Install docker

$ sudo su -
$ yum install docker -y
$ systemctl start docker 

Docker home directory:

cd /var/lib/docker

*************************


Naming convetion for an zimage in docker is as follows

 every image will have a unique name

 every image will have a tag(verison)

 Generally  name of image will look like:

   imagename:tagname

 docker will assume it has to pull image from docker hub library

 so the actual image name is:

 docker.io/library/imagename:tagname


$ docker pull ubuntu


$ docker pull ubuntu:18.04


every user on docker hub have their own repository to store their custom image


 in this case name of image will be

 docker pull  sonal04/myimage:v1

You have your own private container registry and a private repo


 in this case name of image will be

 docker pull  privateregitryip/myrepo/myimage:v1


Commands to pull images on docker:

docker pull ubuntu

$ docker images

$ docker pull ubuntu:18.04

you cannot delete docker official images  in docker hub

but you can deletd the pull images into docker host

$ docker rmi Imagename:tagname 

$ docker rmi ubuntu:18.04

Create the container from an Image:

$ docker run ubuntu

to see if container is created or not

a container will have status like: up, exited, exited(error code), 
$ docker ps -a


will return all the container in any status

$ docker ps

will return containers with status UP & running

$ docker container ls

will return containers with status UP & running


Run options: options to be used with run command

--name : to give a unique name to the container

Creating a container 

 > container should be up & running

Method 1: Foreground mode (-it)

  > the container status will be up & running
  > user will be logged on to the terminal of the container
  > user will be attched/connected to the container

Method 2: Detached mode (-d)

  > the container status will be up & running
  > User will not be attached/connected to the container
  > container will be running like running in background


Command to delete container:

$ docker rm -f containerid/name

Create a container:

docker run --name u1 -it ubuntu

Comeout of container:

comout of container and keep container running

 $ CTL pq

comout of container and keep container Exited status

$ exit


You are on the host machine and you want to connect to terminal of the OS container

$ docker attach containerName/id

$ docker stop u1

$ docker start u1


Execute a command on the conatiner from host cursor

docker exec -it n1 bash


Using the exec or attach command, you can access the application. folders.files on the conatiner

You can access the applicationd eployed on container using your browser and container port number


Port mapping/ port forwarding:

This concept is applicaple to only web image

not applicable to OS image


Port mapping has to be done with docker run command

after the conatiner is created/running, you cannot do port mapping neither you cannot chnage port number

-p  : prt mapping option


-p systemport:containerport

docker run -p 8787:80 --name n2 -d nginx


Method for portmapping 

Use -P option

In this case we dont provide any port number during the run command, docker system will do random port mapping
of system port and container port

docker run -d --name n1 -P nginx


Volumes in Docker:
*************

2 types of volumes in docker


1. Named volume:


Demo1: Let us create a volume and give a name to the volume

Volume is a directory in whcih we will preserve containers data

where will this named volume directlry be available: it will under /var/lib/docker/volumes

$ docker volume create myvol

docker volume ls

docker volume inspect myvol

Location where the colume is created: /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data


Demo 2: preserving the data of the container on the volume directory

 docker run -it --name u1 -v myvol:/tmp ubuntu

 you will be on the container

 cd tmp
 touch file1 file 2

come out of container

ctl pq

go to vol directory

/var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data

ls

all the data will be there

Demo 3: Create a file in the volume directory and check if the data is available on the container or not

Assignment:
Demo 4: Containers sharing the data


2. Bind mounts

Is a type of volume using which you can preserve data of the container on any directory of the host machine


 volume mappping will be done as:

 -v anydirectoryHost:directoryofcontainer

Volume mapping has to be done at runtime only

once container is created you cannot do volume mapping

> Go to a repo with application code in github

> Fetch all the code to local

 > git clone https://github.com/Sonal0409/ecomm.git

 /root/ecomm

> copy the code on the container directory

 Can be done using volume of type bind mounts

> access the container from the browser my machine

DOCKER FILE
*****************************************
Creating our own Images:

2 ways:

1. Creating an image from a running container
2. Using a Docker file

Method 1:Creating an image from a running container

**********************************************

# docker run --name c1 -it centos
	#ls
	# yum update -y
	# yum install git -y
	# git --version
	# ctlp+ctlQ

# docker commit c1 mycentosImage

# docker images   // our image will be available with tag as latest

//Create a container from our own Image

# docker run --name c2 -it mycentosImage
	
push our image into Docker Hub:


# docker tag mycentosImage:latest sonal04/mycentosImage:latest

# docker images   // new image with new name will be created

# docker login   //loginto docker hub
Username:
Password:

# docker push dockerusername/mycentosImage:latest   //image will be pushed to docker hub


Method2 : Creating a docker file and building an image from it
*******************************************************
it is a simple txt file.

# vim dockerfile
	i

FROM centos    // base image information
MAINTAINER edureka
RUN yum -y update            // these are commands that we give for building the image
RUN yum install git -y		// information about packages that shoudl be 					there on the image
VOLUME /data
:wq!

# docker build -t mycentos:git .

When we run the image -->container will be created.

	# docker images


	# docker run --name c1 -it mycentos1:dockerfile
	

==> data folder which is mounted for volume wll be there

	

OTher instructions that we can give in an Image :
FROM: 

MAINTAINER:

RUN:

CMD:

VOLUME:

EXPOSE:

ADD:

**************************************************

Deploy Job in Jenkins:
**************************************
Steps to create a Jenkins job and create docker file and create container for addressbook.war

1. Start the jenkins on AWS instance

# systemctl start jenkins

2. Start docker 
# systemctl start docker

3. Log into jenkins --> go to package job --go to console and copy the path of .war file

4. create a new job -->Deploy

5. Go to build -->shell command

rm -rf mydockerfile
mkdir mydockerfile
cd mydockerfile
cp /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Package/target/addressbook.war .
touch dockerfile
cat <<EOT>> dockerfile
From tomcat
ADD addressbook.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
EOT
sudo docker build -t myimage:$BUILD_NUMBER .
sudo docker run -itd -P myimage:$BUILD_NUMBER

Save the job

Go to instance to give jenkins permission to execute docker commands. As of now we are logged in as admin in jenkins and it doesnt have permission to run docker commands.

So go to
vim /etc/sudoers
i
add under root
Jenkins ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
:wq!

Go back to jenkins and build now.

==> New image and container will be created

# docker images

# docker ps -a

Access from browser

http://18.221.206.57:32768/addressbook/

******************************************************************************
Dockerfile2:

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install nginx -y
COPY index.html /var/www/html/
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx","-g","daemon off;"]




$ docker run -d --name n1 -p 8989:80 myimage02

OR

$ docker run -d --name n1 -P myimage02

**************************************************
Docker networking

To set custome IP address range to your container in docker

sudo vim /etc/default/docker
add this line to file

DOCKER_OPTS="--bip=10.66.33.10/24"
then reboot
after reboot start a container

docker run -it --name t2 jangorecki/r-base-dev /bin/bash
and check ip of a container

docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' t2


OR

docker exec -it c1 bash -c "echo -e 'IPADDR=172.17.0.4 \n HOSTNAME=c1' >> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0; /etc/init.d/network restart";


OR - to change the IP address of this docker container

You will have to first detach the container from the custom network and the connect it back by providing the ip.

You can follow the following steps :

docker network disconnect [OPTIONS] NETWORK CONTAINER
docker network connect --ip 192.168.150.3 NETWORK CONTAINER


docker network ls
   20  docker run -d --name myn1 nginx
   21  docker ps -a
   22  docker inspect myn1
   23  clear
   24  docker network create --driver bridge edureka1
   25  docker network ls
   26  docker network create --driver bridge edureka2
   27  docker network ls
   28  clear
   29  docker run -itd --name b1 --network edureka1 busybox
   30  docker inspect b1
   31  clear
   32  docker run -itd --name b2 --network edureka1 busybox
   33  docker inspect b2
   34  clear
   35  docker attach b1
   36  docker run -itd --name b3 --network edureka2 busybox
   37  docker inspect b3
   38  clear
   39  docker attach b3
   40  docker attach b2
   41  docker network connect edureka2 b2
   42  docker inspect b2
   43  clear
   44  docker attach b2



docker- compose tool
****************************************
install the compose tool

curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.7.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

*****************
Docker Swarm
*****************************

SETUP OF DOCKER SWARM:
******************************
Create 3 AWS instances and name them as Manager, worker 1 and worker 2.

Go to git bash

# cd downloads/

# SSH path from AWS for manager

# sudo su -

# yum install docker

# vim /etc/hostname  ==> to chnage the hostname of this machine to Manager

:wq!  

# init 6  ==> restart the machine


Again open git bash

# cd downloads/

# SSH path from AWS for Worker1

# sudo su -

# yum install docker

# vim /etc/hostname  ==> to chnage the hostname of this machine to Worker1

:wq!  

# init 6  ==> restart the machine

Again open git bash

# cd downloads/

# SSH path from AWS for Worker2


# sudo su -

# yum install docker

# vim /etc/hostname  ==> to chnage the hostname of this machine to Worker2

:wq!  

# init 6  ==> restart the machine

****************************************
Initialize the Swarm Manager:
***************************************
ON MANAGER:
*************
Go to the manager machine and give below command

# systemctl start docker

# docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.31.17.248(privateip of manager)

Curent node will be now be swarm Manager and it will generate a token id that can be executed on worker nodes so that they will join the swarm as workers.

==> Copy the token id on notepad
************************

WORKER1 SETUP
**********************

# systemctl start docker

paste the token command here from notepad  // as shown below:

# docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-66xevqpe5r6h1gtcps1m867q8jcu93deyk87qudqdp7nyf8omk-7vna75w6jip5hmqp4h55bi3s3 172.31.17.248:2377

// the worker1 will now join the swarm as worker
It will give message as: This node joined a swarm as a worker.

MANAGER NODE:

Go to manager node and see if worker1 has joined the swarm or not

# docker node ls

2 nodes will be there .. maanager and worker1


WORKER2 SETUP
**********************

# systemctl start docker

paste the token command here from notepad  // as shown below:

# docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-66xevqpe5r6h1gtcps1m867q8jcu93deyk87qudqdp7nyf8omk-7vna75w6jip5hmqp4h55bi3s3 172.31.17.248:2377

// the worker2 will now join the swarm as worker
It will give message as: This node joined a swarm as a worker.

MANAGER NODE:

Go to manager node and see if worker1 has joined the swarm or not

# docker node ls

3 nodes will be there .. maanager and worker1 and worker2

**********SETUP COMPLETE********************************************


SCEANRIO 1 : LOAD BALANCING or distribution of Service

************************************************

Here we will create a service nginx with 5 replicas and perform port mapping

	# docker service create --name mywb -p 8989:80 --replicas 5 nginx

==>This will create 5 replicas of nginx and it is distributed on the nodes.

==> to check the services

	# docker service ps mywb


 List all services on SWARM
*******************************
	# docker service ls

*********************************
Delete service on the SWARm

	# docker service rm mywb

//removes service

	# docker service ls  // no service will be there
*****************************************
Scaling
****************************
Scenario2:

Using the concept of scaling we can increase or reduce the replicas


1.Create tomcat service with replica 3 with posrt mapping

# docker service create --name mytomcat  -p 9090:8080 --replicas 3 tomcat

2. 	# docker service ps mytomcat

3. Now scale up the service to 5

	# docker service scale mytomcat=5

4. check if 5 replicas of tomcat are running

	# docker service ps mytomcat    

// total of 5 services will be there 2 more services added.

5. Now scale down the services to 3

	# docker service scale mytomcat=3

6.  check if 3 replicas of tomcat are running

	# docker service ps mytomcat    

// total of 3 services will be there.

******************************************
SCENARIO 3: FAILOVER
**************************************
A. Create a httpd service with 6 replicas and delete one replica running on the manager 

1. Create httpd service with 6 replicas

      # docker service create --name mywebserver -p 9090:80 --replicas 6 httpd

2. Check if all 6 replicas are running or not.

 	# docker service ps mywebserver

3. On the MANAGER machine, delete a replica

	# docker ps -a  // replicas will be displayed
	# docker rm -f containername  // replica will be deleted
	
# docker ps -a
# docker service ps mywebserver

3. Drain worker1 from the swarm 
	
	# docker node ls
	# docker node update --availability drain Worker1

4. check if all 6 replicas are running on manager and worker2
 
	# docker service ps mywebserver
	
	# docker service ps mywebserver | grep Running

5. Make worker1 join the swarm again

        # docker node update --availability active Worker1

6. check if all 6 replicas are running on manager and worker1 and 2
 
	# docker service ps mywebserver

7. we can also go to worker2 git bash and leave the swarm
	# systemctl start docker
	# docker swarm leave


8.Connect back to manager

# docker node ls

worker 2 will be in status down and Active

9. Remove the worker2 node from the swarm

	# docker node rm Worker2

Worker 2 will not be in swarm now.

	# docker node ls

9.Check if all the replicas are still running or not.

	# docker services ps webserver

10. join back the worker2 to swarm

	# docker swarm join-token worker

copy the token and paste it on worker 2 machine

docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-195rkd1a6332n2izpccyfn9d29q1mqs72ja0d4ueo63xyetrum-6t7d8m9tfcw9qtj86ske56p0q 172.31.44.159:2377

Worker2 will join the swarm again

on Manager machine:  # docker node ls   // worker 2 will be active and running

**********************************************************
ROLLING UPDATE/ ROLLING OUT:
*************************************************************

Create redis:3 with 5 replicas and update it to redis:4 and latter roll it back to redis:3

1.Create redis:3 with 5 replicas

# docker service create --name myredis --replicas 5 redis:3

2.Check if 5 replicas are running or not

Docker service ps myredis

3.perform a rolling update from redis:3 to redis:4

# docker service update --image redis:4 myredis

4.Check if 5 replicas of redis:3 are shutdown and redis:4 are up and running

# docker service ps myredis

5.Perform roll back from redis:4 to redis:3

# docker service update --rollback myredis

6.Check if 5 replicas of redis:4 are shutdown and redis:3 are up and running

# docker service ps myredis

*****************************************************

OVERLAY NETWORK

****************************************************

Create 1 custom overlay networks overlay1 

Usecase 1: Create a tomcat service in swarm on overlay1 network


1.Create 1 overlay network


# docker network create --driver overlay overlay1

2. Check if the networks are created or not

# docker network ls

3. Start tomcat service with 3 replicas on overlay1 network

# docker service create --name mytomcat -p 8888:80 replicas 3 --network overlay1 tomcat

4. Check if tomcat service is running on overlay1 network

# docker service inspect mytomcat
OR

# docker service inspect mywebserver --pretty


In network you will see netwrok to be overlay1
