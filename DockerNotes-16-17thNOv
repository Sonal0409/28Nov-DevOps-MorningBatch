Docker Notes:
**************************

#### On Centos:

# yum install docker -y

Start docker

# systemctl start docker


### INSTALL DOCKER 

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update ; clear
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce

service docker start



*******************************

Docker HUb -> registry where docker free images are available, you can also store images in Docker hub

However there are many private registry are available where organization tend to save their custom images

Some of the Registries:

Docker HUB

AwS - ECS

DTR - Docker trusted registry

Private registry on your local machine on port 5000


Lets check docker hub and see how bases images are:


Docker Images:
*****************

Every image will have a name and a tag mantodory

Every image can have many tags but signle name

How will docker know form where to pull the image and which tag to pull??


# docker pull ubuntu

Every images carries its address with it


The image name includes

 registryname/reponame/imagename:tagname
  


 when i say just ubuntu : docker will assume by default


  dockerhub/library/ubuntu:latest

docker.io/library/ubuntu:latest

When working in projects-> image name will look like this:

docker pull  awsECR023435345/myapp:01

example.com/admin/webserver:v1

Private registry which on a server (12.34.56.78) and port number 5000

 imagenmae will look like this:

  12.34.56.78:5000/sonal/myimage:tag1



Images Command:

Command to check images on local:

# docker images

# docker pull ubuntu:18.04

Run the Image to launch the Container:

# docker run Imagename:tagname

# docker run ubuntu

to check container details:

# docker ps -a

Various RUN options:

--name ==> you can set a unique name to the container

# docker run --name cont1 ubuntu

# docker ps -a

Run options to start the container:

2 ways to start conatiner

We have to provide any one the options to start the container, otherwise the contaienr will always be in exited


> Forground mode (-it)

This mode is used for images of type OS images

In this case:

> Container will be created
> Contaienr status will be UP
> and you will logged on the container process
> user will be attached to the terminal fo the container

Demo:

# docker run --name cont2 -it ubuntu

Come out of the container:

# ctl + pq

> you will out of conatiner and containe will be running

OR

give exit

> you will out of conatiner and containe will go in exited status

# docker ps -a


How can we attach to the terminal of the OS container again:

# docker attach contName/ContID

This command works only if a container is up & running



> detached Mode (-d)


If your image is of type web, we will use detached mode

# docker run -d --name cont1 nginx


In this case:

> Container will be created
> Contaienr status will be UP
> and you will not logged on the container process
> user will not be attached to the terminal of the container


Agenda:
*********************

> port Mapping

1. This scenario is applicable only to web based Images

2. Port binding will always be done when creating the container

3. Once a container is created/exisitng you cannot do port binding

4. In port binding, you cannot change the container port. You can check the container port on the image by 
checking the option Expose

5. You can give you own system port(ec2 VM port), it can a 4 digit number or 5 digit number

6. every container will have to mapped to a unique system port


It can be done in 2 ways:


1. -p

> in this case user will provide his own systemport and map to the container exposed port

syntax: docker run --name cont2 -d -p systemport:containerport nginx


docker run --name cont2 -d -p 8989:80 nginx

*** 2. -P

In this cases when with run command we give -P option, docker will do the port mapping 
where in random system port will be mapped to container port automatically 

docker run --name cont2 -d -P nginx


**************************************************

Docker Volumes:


> This concept is used to preserve the data of the container's directory on the host machine

> This concept can also be used in order to copy data from hostmachine to contaienr directory

> volume mapping is also done at runtime. if the container is already created, you cannot do the volume mapping

Method: Named Volumes

# docker volume ls

# docker volume create myvol

Named Volumes in docker are always created in the directory => /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol

The data of the container will be preserved in this location:

/var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data


> Now preserve the data of the container's directory on the Host volume myvol

you will mount in the following way:

-v Namedvolume:/anydireof container

docker run -it --name cont1 -v myvol:/tmp ubuntu

Now lets see :

 copy data from hostmachine(volume) to contaienr directory


***********************************

Bind mount

Any directory on the hostmachine can preserve the data of container
and you can copy data on the container sirectory from any host directory

In this case no specific named volume is created

docker run -d --name cont2 -v anydirPath:/pathofcontadir httpd

Integrate git and docker
*****************************

Step 1:

Code is in git hub, I want the code in docker host

# yum install git -y

 git clone https://github.com/Sonal0409/ecomm.git

Present working directory with code

/root/ecomm


Step 2: you need to create a container of image httpd and mount/copy  these code file from host machine 
on the container directory


# docker run -d --name web -v  /root/ecomm/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/     httpd


Step 3: we should also be able to access the contaienr from brower, so what option will you give in the command


# docker run -d --name web -v  /root/ecomm/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/  -P   httpd


Step 4: Deveoper make changes in the github on the index.html file

git pull origin master
